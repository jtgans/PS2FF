This is a simple board to handle exposing of the modern IBM PS/2 media sense
floppy disk controller such that it can be faked out on the controller side.

IOW, FlashFloppy (and by extension Gotek flash-based floppy drives) currently
cannot handle the advanced media sensing back to the PS/2 host controller. This
adapter exposes those media sense pins so that we can "fake" the media report
type to the host controller.
