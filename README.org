* PS/2 to FlashFloppy Media Sense Adapter

NOTE: This is still under development and does not work. Please don't assemble until revision C.

This is a simple board to handle exposing of the modern IBM PS/2 media sense
floppy disk controller such that it can be faked out on the controller side.

IOW, FlashFloppy (and by extension Gotek flash-based floppy drives) currently
cannot handle the advanced media sensing back to the PS/2 host controller. This
adapter exposes those media sense pins so that we can "fake" the media report
type to the host controller.

The board has been fabbed via OshPark, and is available here:

The BoM was picked from DigiKey parts, and is available here:
